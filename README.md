# RAG FOR DRILLING REPORT
## Project Scope
This project aims to provide a simple step by step of building RAG for report especially in drilling report. Most of the report here collected from Volve dataset. 
## LLM Models
We experimented with several LLM, Mistral, OpenAI and LLAMA3.2 via OLLAMA. We suggest that you try OLLAMA to run the LLM and the embedding model locally. 
## RAG Application
The application utilizes Streamlit as UI. We suggest to launch your own FastAPI that run locally, If you opt to use cloud service, ensure that you need to install Ollama Linux version, and pull the both LLM and embedding model. 10 GB should be enough (depending what kind of LLM you pull)
